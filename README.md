## <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
We all love movies and we all love to eat so we decided to combine the two (kind of like peanut butter & Jelly or chocolate and peanut butter). Is peanut butters super power making other things amazing? This app gives you the ability to find movies / TV shows and locate a scene to find a recipe from that scene. For example, if you wanted to make the $5 milkshake from Pulp Fiction, you would be able to find the scene and recipe for that scene. Or if you wanted a morocan recipe from Bourne Identity, you could search by location and find a recipe from that area.
